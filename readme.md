# Decentralized NTU Ticketing System

## 1. Project Proposal

This project is a decentralized ticketing system designed for university events. The system utilizes blockchain technology to issue tickets as NFTs, ensuring security and transparency in ticket sales and transfers. It addresses common problems like ticket fraud and scalping.

Main features:
- **NFT Tickets**: Each ticket is issued as a non-fungible token.
- **Pre-sale and Public-sale**: Supports phased ticket sales.
- **Ticket Validation**: Built-in verification system to confirm ticket authenticity.
- **Secondary Market**: Allows users to resell tickets securely.

## 3. Technology and Tools

**Blockchain Platform:** Ethereum

**Dev Tools:**
- Front-end: *HTML, CSS*
- Back-end: *Python with Flask, Node.js*
- Smart Contract: *Solidity*

## 4. Design and Development

### 4.1 Prototypes

#### 4.1.1 Pre-sale and Public-sale
The system should supports both pre-sale and public-sale phases. During the presale,  can purchase tickets before they are available to the general public. Afterward, the public sale opens, allowing all users to buy tickets directly from the platform.

#### 4.1.2 NFT Minting
When users purchase a ticket, the system mints an NFT representing the ticket on the blockchain. This ensures each ticket is unique, tamper-proof, and verifiable on-chain. Users can view their NFT tickets in their digital wallet.
